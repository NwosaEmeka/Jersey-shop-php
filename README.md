The PHP version is hosted here [EMS JERSEY](https://ems-jersey.000webhostapp.com/)

Gaffer Jersey Shop was created with React, Node as backend and firebase 
for authentication and storage.

EMS Jersey shop is created with PHP and MYSQL 

##Features of EMS Shop PHP
- Admin panel (add, update, delete product and manage customers orders) 

- user (register details, login, search and browse items, add item to 
cart, checkout)


## Proposed Todo
- Integrate with stripe for payment processing
- Filter products
